Linux Distributions Metadata

The Linux Distributions Metadata project is a set of tool to map descriptive
metadata about linux distributions in an unified database. The scripts will
download the data and make transformations, selecting common fields and
organizing in an standard format. In the current stage of the project, our main
goal is to map the metadata of software packages from those distributions.

All the information is from public domain, hosted at Linux Distributions
servers, and acessible from any computer.
